# Testing Stimulus Equivalence as a Reinforcement Learning task.

**First attemp:** 
A DQN agent in a simultaneous matching to sample procedure. 5 classes of 7 members are trained in Linear Series training structure. 1 state and 1 action are required to reach terminal state. A state is the presentation of all 4 stimuli (sample and 3 comparisons). Actions are the options.
