# Equivalence relations
### Evaluating a psychological phenomena on machine learning algorithms *

* WORK IN PROGRESS

This python script contains arrays on the task of evaluating relational derived response as a psychological phenomena related with complex behaviors such as cognition or language from a behaviorist viewpoint.

The data are arrays of two list of bits where the first one is the encoded (sample) set of stimulus presented. The second is the (target) expected correct answer.
