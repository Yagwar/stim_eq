# Simulating Equivalence relations
### Evaluating a psychological phenomena on machine learning algorithms *
(* WORK IN PROGRESS)

The experiments are based on matching to sample procedures for evaluating relational derived response, a psychological phenomena related with complex behaviour such as cognition or language, from a behaviorist viewpoint (the psychological "school" that inspired reinforcement learning). The objective is to create a ML algorithm that be capable of mark the related stimulus, evidencing emergent relations among the stimuli.

There are related experiments and publications separated by folders.
