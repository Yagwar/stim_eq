# Stimulus Equivalence in Equivalence Projective Simulation (EPS)
[EPS](https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01274) and [E-EPS](https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01346) models are proposed by Asieh Mofrad and is the only agent truly capable of show emergent relations. This experiment attemps to simulate SE in EPS agents on experiemantal conditions realted to Control by Negative Stimulus (CNS).
