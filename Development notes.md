# Reinforcement learning algortihms for derived relational response
The basic idea of the project is test reinforcement learning algorithms on a basic task of derived relational response.

## Developing Dataset.
It has an 80% of teir final form. Some chenges are needed. 
We have 4 data files. 
The first is trainning dataset

## Firs test
The first test was done with algorithms from scikit-learn. It was tested on shallow classifiers and a Fully-conected feed-forward network in order to get a performance baseline.

## From here...
 
 ### Deepmind's IQ test (dataset)
 I've found some similarities with deepmind projects.
 
 They are working with a dataset that they created inspired on Raven Iq test. However, they are testing nets without knowing whats happening inside the network.

This could be usefull to compare the performance of the algorithms and found a possible relation between Abstract reasoning and Relational response.
