# Reinforcement learning algortihms for derived relational response
The basic idea of the project is test reinforcement learning algorithms on a basic task of derived relational response.

## Phase 1. Developing Dataset.
It has an 80% of teir final form. Some chenges are needed. 
We have 4 data files. 
The first is trainning dataset
