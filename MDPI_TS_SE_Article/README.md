# Differences of Training Structures on the Stimulus Class Formation in Computational Agents

**Abstract:** Stimulus Equivalence (SE) is a behavioural phenomenon in which organisms responds functionally to stimuli without explicit training. Previous research has trying to replicate SE with computational agents, mostly based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Results has been promissory although non conclusive, except for the proposal of Mofrad, et al. as the most robust approach to date. The objective is to analyse the effect of three training structures (TS) on class formation in a simulation with ANN as computational agents performing a classification task, in a matching to sample procedure. 12 simulations were performed as product of the implementation of 4 ANN architectures on the three TS. SE was not achieved, but 2 agents showed emergent response on half of the transitivity test pairs on linear sequence TS and reflexivity on one member of the class. Results suggest that an ANN with a large enough number of units in a hidden layer can perform a limited number of emergent relations within specific experimental conditions: reflexivity on B and transitivity on AC when pairs AB and BC are trained of a three-member class and tested in a classification task. Reinforcement Learning is proposed as the framework for further simulations.
