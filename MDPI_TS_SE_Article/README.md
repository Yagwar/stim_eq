# Differences of Training Structures on the Stimulus Class Formation in Computational Agents
The objective is to analyse the effect of three training structures (TS) on class formation in a simulation with ANN as computational agents performing a classification task, in a matching to sample procedure.
Each notebook represents a simulation with a specific trainning structure.
