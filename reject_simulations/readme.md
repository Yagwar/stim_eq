# Examining Reject Relations in Stimulus Equivalence Simulations
This is the repository for the code on the simulations of Reject control.


This project investigates the role of reject relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational models. We examined the performance of feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) across 18 experimental conditions. These conditions varied training structure (linear series, one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased) in matching-to-sample (MTS) simulations. A probabilistic agent served as a benchmark.

The simulations aim to determine whether artificial neural networks can demonstrate equivalence class formation or if their performance can be explained by associative learning of select (S+) and reject (S-) relations.
